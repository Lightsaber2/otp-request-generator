# otp-request-generator
This script demonstrates how web applicationsâ€™ OTP services can be tested for rate-limiting vulnerabilities. It works by:  Sending alternating POST requests to two different OTP endpoints.  Using custom headers and payloads to simulate real browser traffic.  Allowing testers to check if the application blocks excessive OTP requests.
